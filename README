Rdio Web Playback jQuery plugin, version 0.1

This is a pretty simple plugin to provide a jQuery interface to Rdio's
Web Playback API <http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/Web_Playback_API>

It includes and uses SWFObject <http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/> to
hide much of the complexity of cross-browser Flash embedding.

To use jquery.rdio.js in your web app include jQuery and either
jquery.rdio.min.js or jquery.rdio.js in your HTML. Add a placeholder <div>
that the API swf will be embedded in.

Call $('#placeholder').rdio('playbackToken') to embed the swf. Then call
$('#placeholder').rdio().method() to call playback API methods. They're
exactly the same as are documented in the playback API docs but without
the "rdio_" prefix. For example $('#placeholder').rdio().play('a171827');

Callbacks are exposed as jQuery events in the 'rdio' namespace that are
triggered on the placeholder element. So to get called when the API is
ready use: $('#placeholder').bind('ready.rdio', function(e) { ... });
Callback arguments are mapped to jQuery event handler arguments like:
$('#placeholder').bind('playStateChanged', function (e, playState) { ... });

There's an example for all of this in the example/ directory.

To use this plugin you'll need to get a playbackToken through the Rdio
Web Service API: http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/Methods#getPlaybackToken
